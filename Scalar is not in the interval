scalar = input("10,000.00")

valid_scalar = False
while not valid_scalar:
    try:
        scalar = float(scalar)
        valid_scalar = True
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input.10,000.00.")

# Use the scalar value in your code here
# 10,000.00

```

5. Once you have pasted the code, you can add an optional commit message in the "Commit changes" section at the bottom of the page.
6. Finally, click on the "Commit new file" button to save the changes.

Now, you have successfully added the code snippet to a file in your GitHub repository. You can continue making any other necessary changes or additions to the file if needed.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
